- **Class Activity/**: Contains the class activity files with the tasks to be completed.
    - `CA_1.py`: Task to handle `ZeroDivisionError` and `ValueError`.
    - `CA_2.py`: Task to raise a custom exception for negative numbers.
    - `CA_3.py`: Task to handle `FileNotFoundError` and ensure file closure.
    - `CA_4.py`: Task to handle non-numeric and negative inputs, and write valid numbers to a file.

- **Solution to Class Activity/**: Contains the solutions to the class activities.
    - `solution_CA_1.py`: Solution for handling `ZeroDivisionError` and `ValueError`.
    - `solution_CA_2.py`: Solution for raising a custom exception for negative numbers.
    - `solution_CA_3.py`: Solution for handling `FileNotFoundError` and ensuring file closure.
    - `solution_CA_4.py`: Solution for handling non-numeric and negative inputs, and writing valid numbers to a file.

- **README.md**: The file you are currently reading, which provides an overview of the repository and instructions on how to use it.
